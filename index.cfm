This is a very old framework but still some of the websites are using this framework.
If the applications are using this framework,we don't need to remove it 
and it is better if we learn this framework because the concept of most of the frameworks 
are same.We are following the mvc structure.
There are few frameworks which are used in ColdFusion and Lucee applications but Mach-II
and fusebox are the frameworks which are mostly used.
