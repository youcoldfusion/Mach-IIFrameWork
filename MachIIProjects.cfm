There are a lot of projects which are using Mach-II framework for ColdFusion
and Lucee Projects.I have attached the code in zip folder which you can use to
develop any projects from scratch using mach-ii framework.
Number of developers are very less but Machii framework can be
used for existing projects and new projects.
